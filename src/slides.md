## The most common process for deployment

1. Make local changes to code.
2. Push the changes to GitHub.
3. A webhook notifies a server to build the project.
4. A server pulls the new code from Github.
5. The server builds the site.
6. HTML files from the built project (along with any necessary assets) to a CDN.
7. Server informs CDN to invalidate its cache (hopefully).
8. ?????
9. Profit.
